# Hackathon Management System

## Project Overview

This project is a **Hackathon Management System** developed as part of the
**Information Management & Systems Engineering (IMSE)** course.

The system provides functionality to:

* manage hackathon events
* register participants
* store project submissions
* view analytics and statistics

The implementation follows the requirements of **Milestone 2**, including:

* containerized infrastructure
* relational database setup
* database initialization with schema
* a modern web-based interface

---

## System Infrastructure

The project uses a **container-based architecture** with Docker.

### Components

* **Backend**

  * Node.js with Express
  * Provides REST API endpoints
  * Connects to the MariaDB database
  * Runs on port 3000

* **Relational Database**

  * MariaDB 10.11
  * Stores events, participants, registrations, submissions, judges, sponsors, and workshops
  * Uses a persistent Docker volume
  * Schema initialized via SQL script on container startup

* **Frontend**

  * React 18 with TypeScript
  * Vite build tool
  * Tailwind CSS for styling
  * shadcn/ui component library
  * Pages: Home, Register Event, Submit Project, Analytics
  * Served via Nginx on port 3000

All components are started and connected using **Docker Compose**.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need:

* Docker
* Docker Compose

No local installation of Node.js or MySQL is required, as everything runs inside containers.

---

## How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```sh
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER>
```

### Step 2: Build and start the system

```sh
docker compose up --build
```
This command will:

* build the frontend container (React app served via Nginx)
* build the backend container (Node.js/Express API)
* start the MariaDB database container
* initialize the database schema from `sql/create.sql`

### Step 3: Access the application

* Frontend (Web interface): [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) 

---

## Database Schema (Task 2.2.1)

The database schema is defined in `sql/create.sql` and includes the following tables:

* **Person** - Base entity for participants and judges (ISA relationship)
* **Participant** - Extends Person with hackathon-specific attributes
* **Judge** - Extends Person with judging expertise
* **InnovationManager** - Recursive relationship for participant mentorship
* **Venue** - Event locations
* **Sponsor** - Event sponsors with tier levels
* **HackathonEvent** - Main event entity
* **Workshop** - Workshops within events
* **Supports** - M:N relationship between Sponsors and Events
* **Registration** - Participant event registrations
* **Submission** - Project submissions
* **Creates** - M:N relationship between Participants and Submissions
* **Evaluates** - Judge scores and feedback for submissions

The schema is automatically applied when the database container starts for the first time.
This fulfills the **DB Setup / Data Import / Base Function** requirement of Milestone 2.

## Notes

* No external authentication providers or third-party services are used.
* The setup is designed to be reproducible on a clean machine using Docker.
* Database credentials are configured in `docker-compose.yml` for development purposes.
